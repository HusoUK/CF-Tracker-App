# CF-Tracker-App
A web app to help CF patients keep track of key health results.

This web application simply requires a user to login with an email and password, 
create a user profile, then users can record key results. The results can then be 
viewed in a graph and list format.

This app uses:

- .NET MVC.
- Indentity.
- Entity Frame Core.
- ChartJS.

Things I would like to add in the future:

- Faceook or Google login.
- Blood sugar tracker.
- Food Diary.
- Medication lists.
- User roles, such as patient, doctor, nurse.
- Chat/ messenger.

Notes:

I used ChatGPT to generate the JavaScript code for all the charts.
